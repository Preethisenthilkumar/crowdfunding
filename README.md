A crowdfunding solution that lets projects raise capital from diverse sources. So a project manager looking to raise money for their project can:

1. Start a campaign (including saving details of the campaign that contributors might want to look at before contributing)
2. Be able to edit campaign details
3. Set a crowdfunding goal
4. Set a crowdfunding deadline
5. If a campaign goal is met, be able to post updates for their donors to see
6. Set any rewards that might be applicable for contributing some specific amounts

The other users of the platform are the contributors. They should have be able to:

1. Have access to all campaigns currently running
2. Donate a specific amount to a campaign
3. If the crowdfunding goal isn't met, get a full refund
4. If a vote of no confidence is passed, get a proportional refund
5. Get any rewards they are entitled to if the goals are met
